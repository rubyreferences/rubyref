## Standard Library

The Ruby Standard Library is a vast collection of classes and modules
that you can require in your code for additional features.

This chapter provides documentation and links to class and module
references for all sub-libraries.

Some notes about this chapter's structure:

* Libraries are grouped into logical sections; inside each section
  libraries are listed alphabetically;
* Libraries known to be of leasser usage or support are mentioned
  briefly in the [last section](stdlib/misc/other.md);
* Some libraries documentation is moved to the [previous
  part](builtin.md) of this Reference with an attached note indicating
  it is part of the standard library. For example,
  [Set](builtin/types/set.md) is documented beside
  [Hash](builtin/types/hash.md) and [Array](builtin/types/array.md),
  [Pathname](builtin/system-cli/filesystem.md#pahtname) is documented
  beside [File](builtin/system-cli/filesystem.md#file) and
  [Dir](builtin/system-cli/filesystem.md#dir), and so on.
* IRB (Ruby interactive console) and RDoc (Ruby documentation tool),
  despite being formally parts of standard library, are documented in
  the [Developing in Ruby](developing.md) chapter.

Note also that Ruby comes with so-called "bundled gems", which are
formally not parts of standard library, but always installed with Ruby.
Those are listed in the [Bundled Gems](stdlib/bundled.md) chapter.

For installing and developing third-party libraries, see the
[RubyGems](developing/libraries.md) chapter.
