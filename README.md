## The Ruby Reference

This book is the reference for the Ruby programming language created by
Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It describes the language structure, its core
classes and standard library, and provides some additional useful
information and links for Ruby development.

The Reference is intended to be always up-to-date with the current Ruby
version.

Most of the reference content is taken directly from <a
href='https://ruby-doc.org' class='ruby-doc remote' target='_blank'>Ruby
documentation</a> and reorganized for easier reading. The core docs were
augumented with some quotes from the <a href='https://ruby-lang.org'
class='remote' target='_blank'>Ruby website</a>, and some missing
content that is written specifically for the book. The source of the
book (rendering scripts, config, and unique content) can be found at <a
href='https://github.com/rubyreferences/rubyref/tree/master/_src'
class='remote' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>.

Happy Hacking!
