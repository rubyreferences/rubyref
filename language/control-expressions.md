## Control Expressions

Ruby has a variety of ways to control execution. All the expressions
described here return a value.

For the tests in these control expressions, `nil` and `false` are
false-values and `true` and any other object are true-values. In this
document "true" will mean "true-value" and "false" will mean
"false-value".

### `if` Expression

The simplest `if` expression has two parts, a "test" expression and a
"then" expression. If the "test" expression evaluates to a true then the
"then" expression is evaluated.

Here is a simple if statement:


```ruby
if true then
  puts "the test resulted in a true-value"
end
```

This will print "the test resulted in a true-value".

The `then` is optional:


```ruby
if true
  puts "the test resulted in a true-value"
end
```

This document will omit the optional `then` for all expressions as that
is the most common usage of `if`.

You may also add an `else` expression. If the test does not evaluate to
true the `else` expression will be executed:


```ruby
if false
  puts "the test resulted in a true-value"
else
  puts "the test resulted in a false-value"
end
```

This will print "the test resulted in a false-value".

You may add an arbitrary number of extra tests to an if expression using
`elsif`. An `elsif` executes when all tests above the `elsif` are false.


```ruby
a = 1

if a == 0
  puts "a is zero"
elsif a == 1
  puts "a is one"
else
  puts "a is some other value"
end
```

This will print "a is one" as `1` is not equal to `0`. Since `else` is
only executed when there are no matching conditions.

Once a condition matches, either the `if` condition or any `elsif`
condition, the `if` expression is complete and no further tests will be
performed.

Like an `if`, an `elsif` condition may be followed by a `then`.

In this example only "a is one" is printed:


```ruby
a = 1

if a == 0
  puts "a is zero"
elsif a == 1
  puts "a is one"
elsif a >= 1
  puts "a is greater than or equal to one"
else
  puts "a is some other value"
end
```

The tests for `if` and `elsif` may have side-effects. The most common
use of side-effect is to cache a value into a local variable:


```ruby
if a = object.some_value
  # do something to a
end
```

The result value of an `if` expression is the last value executed in the
expression.

### Ternary if

You may also write a if-then-else expression using `?` and `:`. This
ternary if:


```ruby
input_type = gets =~ /hello/i ? "greeting" : "other"
```

Is the same as this `if` expression:


```ruby
input_type =
  if gets =~ /hello/i
    "greeting"
  else
    "other"
  end
```

While the ternary if is much shorter to write than the more verbose
form, for readability it is recommended that the ternary if is only used
for simple conditionals. Also, avoid using multiple ternary conditions
in the same expression as this can be confusing.

### `unless` Expression

The `unless` expression is the opposite of the `if` expression. If the
value is false, the "then" expression is executed:


```ruby
unless true
  puts "the value is a false-value"
end
```

This prints nothing as true is not a false-value.

You may use an optional `then` with `unless` just like `if`.

Note that the above `unless` expression is the same as:


```ruby
if not true
  puts "the value is a false-value"
end
```

Like an `if` expression you may use an `else` condition with `unless`: 

```ruby
unless true
  puts "the value is false"
else
  puts "the value is true"
end
```

This prints "the value is true" from the `else` condition.

You may not use `elsif` with an `unless` expression.

The result value of an `unless` expression is the last value executed in
the expression.

### Modifier `if` and `unless`

`if` and `unless` can also be used to modify an expression. When used as
a modifier the left-hand side is the "then" expression and the
right-hand side is the "test" expression:


```ruby
a = 0

a += 1 if a.zero?

p a
```

This will print 1.


```ruby
a = 0

a += 1 unless a.zero?

p a
```

This will print 0.

While the modifier and standard versions have both a "test" expression
and a "then" expression, they are not exact transformations of each
other due to parse order. Here is an example that shows the difference:


```ruby
p a if a = 0.zero?
```

This raises the NameError "undefined local variable or method `a`".

When ruby parses this expression it first encounters `a` as a method
call in the "then" expression, then later it sees the assignment to `a`
in the "test" expression and marks `a` as a local variable.

When running this line it first executes the "test" expression, `a =
0.zero?`.

Since the test is true it executes the "then" expression, `p a`. Since
the `a` in the body was recorded as a method which does not exist the
NameError is raised.

The same is true for `unless`.

### `case` Expression

The `case` expression can be used in two ways.

The most common way is to compare an object against multiple patterns.
The patterns are matched using the +===+ method which is aliased to +==+
on Object. Other classes must override it to give meaningful behavior.
See Module#=== and `Regexp#===` for examples.

Here is an example of using `case` to compare a String against a
pattern:


```ruby
case "12345"
when /^1/
  puts "the string starts with one"
else
  puts "I don't know what the string starts with"
end
```

Here the string `"12345"` is compared with `/^1/` by calling `/^1/ ===
"12345"` which returns `true`. Like the `if` expression, the first
`when` that matches is executed and all other matches are ignored.

If no matches are found, the `else` is executed.

The `else` and `then` are optional, this `case` expression gives the
same result as the one above:


```ruby
case "12345"
when /^1/
  puts "the string starts with one"
end
```

You may place multiple conditions on the same `when`: 

```ruby
case "2"
when /^1/, "2"
  puts "the string starts with one or is '2'"
end
```

Ruby will try each condition in turn, so first `/^1/ === "2"` returns
`false`, then `"2" === "2"` returns `true`, so "the string starts with
one or is '2'" is printed.

You may use `then` after the `when` condition. This is most frequently
used to place the body of the `when` on a single line.


```
case a
when 1, 2 then puts "a is one or two
when 3    then puts "a is three"
else           puts "I don't know what a is"
end
```

The other way to use a `case` expression is like an if-elsif expression:


```ruby
a = 2

case
when a == 1, a == 2
  puts "a is one or two"
when a == 3
  puts "a is three"
else
  puts "I don't know what a is"
end
```

Again, the `then` and `else` are optional.

The result value of a `case` expression is the last value executed in
the expression.

### `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes while a condition is true:


```ruby
a = 0

while a < 10 do
  p a
  a += 1
end

p a
```

Prints the numbers 0 through 10. The condition `a < 10` is checked
before the loop is entered, then the body executes, then the condition
is checked again. When the condition results in false the loop is
terminated.

The `do` keyword is optional. The following loop is equivalent to the
loop above:


```ruby
while a < 10
  p a
  a += 1
end
```

The result of a `while` loop is `nil` unless `break` is used to supply a
value.

### `until` Loop

The `until` loop executes while a condition is false:


```ruby
a = 0

until a > 10 do
  p a
  a += 1
end

p a
```

This prints the numbers 0 through 11. Like a while loop the condition `a
>
10` is checked when entering the loop and each time the loop body
executes. If the condition is false the loop will continue to execute.

Like a `while` loop, the `do` is optional.

Like a `while` loop, the result of an `until` loop is nil unless `break`
is used.

### `for` Loop

The `for` loop consists of `for` followed by a variable to contain the
iteration argument followed by `in` and the value to iterate over using
`#each`. The `do` is optional:


```ruby
for value in [1, 2, 3] do
  puts value
end
```

Prints 1, 2 and 3.

Like `while` and `until`, the `do` is optional.

The result value of a `for` loop is the value iterated over unless
`break` is used.

Unlike other languages, a Ruby program typically doesn't need a `for`
loop, using [Enumerable](../builtin/types/enumerable.md) instead:


```ruby
# Not idiomatic
for i in 0..3
  # ...
end
# Idiomatic
(0..3).each do |i|
  # ...
end

# Not idiomatic: selecting items
odds = []
for value in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  odds.push(value) if value.odd?
end
# Still not idiomatic: just each
odds = []
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each do |value|
  odds.push(value) if value.odd?
end
# Idiomatic: specialized Enumerable method
odds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select { |value| value.odd? }
# Simplify with Symbol#to_proc
odds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select(&:odd?)
```

Note that in a lot of cases `until` and `while` loops also could be
replaced with `Enumerable` methods like `#take_while`, `#drop_while` and
others.

### Modifier `while` and `until`

Like `if` and `unless`, `while` and `until` can be used as modifiers:


```ruby
a = 0

a += 1 while a < 10

p a # prints 10
```

`until` used as a modifier:


```ruby
a = 0

a += 1 until a > 10

p a # prints 11
```

You can use `begin` and `end` to create a `while` loop that runs the
body once before the condition:


```ruby
a = 0

begin
  a += 1
end while a < 10

p a # prints 10
```

If you don't use `rescue` or `ensure`, Ruby optimizes away any exception
handling overhead.

### `break` Statement

Use `break` to leave a block early. This will stop iterating over the
items in `values` if one of them is even:


```ruby
values.each do |value|
  break if value.even?

  # ...
end
```

You can also terminate from a `while` loop using `break`: 

```ruby
a = 0

while true do
  p a
  a += 1

  break if a < 10
end

p a
```

This prints the numbers 0 and 1.

`break` accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is
"breaking" out of:


```ruby
result = [1, 2, 3].each do |value|
  break value * 2 if value.even?
end

p result # prints 4
```

### `next` Statement

Use `next` to skip the rest of the current iteration:


```ruby
result = [1, 2, 3].map do |value|
  next if value.even?

  value * 2
end

p result # prints [2, nil, 6]
```

`next` accepts an argument that can be used as the result of the current
block iteration:


```ruby
result = [1, 2, 3].map do |value|
  next value if value.even?

  value * 2
end

p result # prints [2, 2, 6]
```

### `redo` Statement

Use `redo` to redo the current iteration:


```ruby
result = []

while result.length < 10 do
  result << result.length

  redo if result.last.even?

  result << result.length + 1
end

p result
```

This prints \[0, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11\]

In Ruby 1.8, you could also use `retry` where you used `redo`. This is
no longer true, now you will receive a SyntaxError when you use `retry`
outside of a `rescue` block. See [Exceptions](exceptions.md) for proper
usage of `retry`.

### Use `throw` to exit from nested loops.

When searching for one condition in a recursive data structure, such as
nested arrays, one can use `throw` to exit from the nested loops.
This is convenient because `break` only exits one loop. 

```
def found_value(matrix, &block)
  value = catch(:found) do
    matrix.each do |row|
      row.each do |item|
        throw :found, item if yield(item)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This funtions returns the first element matching a condition in a two dimensions matrix.
This is faster than using exceptions, because there is no stack trace to build here. 
Please also note the `catch` and the `throw` do not have to be in the same method. 

### Flip-Flop

The flip-flop is a rarely seen conditional expression. It's primary use
is for processing text from ruby one-line programs used with `ruby -n`
or `ruby
-p`.

The form of the flip-flop is an expression that indicates when the
flip-flop turns on, `..` (or `...`), then an expression that indicates
when the flip-flop will turn off. While the flip-flop is on it will
continue to evaluate to `true`, and `false` when off.

Here is an example:


```ruby
selected = []

0.upto 10 do |value|
  selected << value if value==2..value==8
end

p selected # prints [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

In the above example, the on condition is `n==2`. The flip-flop is
initially off (false) for 0 and 1, but becomes on (true) for 2 and
remains on through 8. After 8 it turns off and remains off for 9 and 10.

The flip-flop must be used inside a conditional such as `if`, `while`,
`unless`, `until` etc. including the modifier forms.

When you use an inclusive range (`..`), the off condition is evaluated
when the on condition changes:


```ruby
selected = []

0.upto 5 do |value|
  selected << value if value==2..value==2
end

p selected # prints [2]
```

Here, both sides of the flip-flop are evaluated so the flip-flop turns
on and off only when `value` equals 2. Since the flip-flop turned on in
the iteration it returns true.

When you use an exclusive range (`...`), the off condition is evaluated
on the following iteration:


```ruby
selected = []

0.upto 5 do |value|
  selected << value if value==2...value==2
end

p selected # prints [2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Here, the flip-flop turns on when `value` equals 2, but doesn't turn off
on the same iteration. The off condition isn't evaluated until the
following iteration and `value` will never be two again.
