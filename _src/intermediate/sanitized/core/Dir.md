# Dir

Objects of class `Dir` are directory streams representing directories in the
underlying file system. They provide a variety of ways to list directories and
their contents. See also `File`.

The directory used in these examples contains the two regular files
(`config.h` and `main.rb`), the parent directory (`..`), and the directory
itself (`.`).
