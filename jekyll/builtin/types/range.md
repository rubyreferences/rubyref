# Range

A `Range` represents an interval—a set of values with a beginning and an
end. Ranges may be constructed using the *s*`..`*e* and *s*`...`*e*
literals, or with Range::new. Ranges constructed using `..` run from the
beginning to the end inclusively. Those created using `...` exclude the
end value. When used as an iterator, ranges return each value in the
sequence.


```ruby
(-1..-5).to_a      #=> []
(-5..-1).to_a      #=> [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]
('a'..'e').to_a    #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
('a'...'e').to_a   #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

## Custom Objects in Ranges

Ranges can be constructed using any objects that can be compared using
the `<=>` operator. Methods that treat the range as a sequence (#each
and methods inherited from Enumerable) expect the begin object to
implement a `succ` method to return the next object in sequence. The
`#step` and `#include?` methods require the begin object to implement
`succ` or to be numeric.

In the `Xs` class below both `<=>` and `succ` are implemented so `Xs`
can be used to construct ranges. Note that the Comparable module is
included so the `==` method is defined in terms of `<=>`.


```ruby
class Xs                # represent a string of 'x's
  include Comparable
  attr :length
  def initialize(n)
    @length = n
  end
  def succ
    Xs.new(@length + 1)
  end
  def <=>(other)
    @length <=> other.length
  end
  def to_s
    sprintf "%2d #{inspect}", @length
  end
  def inspect
    'x' * @length
  end
end
```

An example of using `Xs` to construct a range:


```ruby
r = Xs.new(3)..Xs.new(6)   #=> xxx..xxxxxx
r.to_a                     #=> [xxx, xxxx, xxxxx, xxxxxx]
r.member?(Xs.new(5))       #=> true
```
