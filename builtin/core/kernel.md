## Kernel[](#kernel)

The Kernel module is included by class Object, so its methods are
available in every Ruby object.

The Kernel instance methods are documented in class Object while the
module methods are documented here. These methods are called without a
receiver and thus can be called in functional form:


```ruby
sprintf "%.1f", 1.234 #=> "1.2"
```

> Kernel methods.
